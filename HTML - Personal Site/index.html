      <p><em>Software Engineer with interest in <strong>Machine Learning, Algorithm & Data Structures </strong> and <strong>Systems Design</strong></em></p>
      <p>
        I have a wide interest in Computer Science and building software products. I love to work on artificial intelligence and building highly scalable software systems.
        I also spend a good part of time doing mathematics, reading science and playing music. Apart from this I ❤️ running, cycling, and other kind of sports, like
        traveling/hiking and spend time with friends and family. You can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/suvro-banerjee-9345442a/">LinkedIn</a>,
